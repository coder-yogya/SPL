Byte.ai Model Integration & Architecture Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------

We will utilize approximately 9 to 10 high-performance models
sourced from HuggingFace Hub (huggingface.co), leveraging the
`transformers` module for integration.

Key Steps:

1. Load models using `transformers.pipeline`.
2. Download model weights via `snapshot_download`.
3. Apply TensorFlow quantization techniques to optimize
model sizes and performance for Apple Silicon (M2 chip).
4. Architect a dedicated Python class for each model.
- Each class will encapsulate specific functions
according to the model’s structure and capabilities.
5. Assign models based on task specialization:
- Summarization: `Qwen2`
- Image Generation: `DALL·E` (via api as we cannot install it locally m2 is not a powerhouse)
- Text Generation: `GPT-2`
- more...

These classes will be modularly imported and invoked in `main.py` and first been loaded in `load.py`.
